# Frontend Challenge
Here is a challenge we would like you to complete to help assess and show off your frontend skills. This is an example of a real world problem you would need to solve while working at Flat World. We do not expect you to spend more than an hour or two on this project.

![Flat World Table](/table.png?raw=true "Flat World Table")

## Instructions
Please recreate the table (illustrated above) utilizing either React or Vue.js. The table should be sortable by each column (note that the last column—the ESG Score and graph—are considered one column) and should be able to be paged through. The [included data file](/data.json?raw=true) includes 250 records to populate. While you do not need to worry about optimizing the table for the fastest possible loading (and sorting) of data, be prepared to discuss different tactics you might take to do so in your followup interview. We would like you to closely match the design as possible.
* All required fonts can be included directly from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/).
* If you would like to use a library like normalize.css that is fine, but all CSS for implementing the design should be written from scratch (in other words, without using a framework like Bootstrap).
* Use of a preprocessor like SASS/SCSS is actively encouraged.
* Use of a frontend build tool is actively encouraged (we prefer Webpack, but use whatever you prefer.)
* Please make sure you include all of your source code, including SCSS/LESS files, configurations for build tools, etc.

## Submission
When you are ready to submit your solution, please follow these instructions:
* Fork this repo on your own GitHub account.
* Commit all of your work to the fork, including all of your source code and configuration files, as well as any compiled files.
* Submit a pull request to this repository.
